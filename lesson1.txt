        var: Declares variables with function or global scope and allows re-declaration and updates within the same scope.
        let: Declares variables with block scope, allowing updates but not re-declaration within the same block.
        const: Declares block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.

exercises
-Display a message on console
-Define a const variable and display it to console
-Define a variable with an initial value and display it to console. Then change the value of the variable and display it to console
-Define 2 numbers and do the basic arithmetic operations with them
-Do arithmetic operations with 2 numbers and display their result like this:
    "The result of the operation addition is 56" (repeat for each operation)"

Fix the errors

Error 1
let num1 = 10
let num2 = "5";
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(Sum); // Error here

Predict the output

let x = "5";
let y = 2;
console.log(x + y); // ?
console.log(x - y); // ?
console.log(x * y); // ?
console.log(Number(x) + y); // ?

Check data types

Home work
Create an program that asks the user for input of two numbers. After inputing the numbers then the programa
will calculate 4 basic operations with those numbers (+-*/). Display the results in the following way:
"The result of the operation (name of operation) is (reuslt)"
